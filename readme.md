# Level 2 Tool - Prophet

## Installation

`npm install`

If you run into errors regarding the `canvas` dependency, try running

`npm install -g node-gyp`and then
`brew install pkg-config cairo libpng jpeg giflib`

This fixed the issue for me

## Running the app

`npm start`

# Introduction

The Level 2 tool will be part of the online IBM Watson Health brand guidelines and will allow users to create on-brand image by layering transparent images and pre-made on-brand graphical elements (various gradient lines). Once the user is done creating their image they will be able to download a PNG of the result. The tool will be primarily for desktop browsers.

The work will be based on the prior Level 3 tool (http://bitbucket.org/automatastudios/prophet-watson-poc.git) and will utilize the styling and UI elements used there. Skye Alcorn developed that tool and itâ€™s recommended that the developer for the project review that codebase with him prior to starting.
